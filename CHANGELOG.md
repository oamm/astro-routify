- `streamJsonArray()` â€” Stream large arrays incrementally with low memory overhead
- Automatic handling of abort signals and connection termination for streamed responses
- Internal streaming helpers (`StreamWriter`, `JsonStreamWriter`) provide ergonomic developer APIs

### ðŸ§ª Examples

### ðŸ›  Changed
